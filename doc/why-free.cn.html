	<h2>Why Software Should Not Have Owners</h2>
	<h2>为什么软件不应该有主人</h2>

	<p>by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/"><strong>Richard Stallman</strong></a></p>
	<p>作者：<a href="http://www.stallman.org/"><strong>Richard Stallman</strong></a></p>

	<p>
	  Digital information technology contributes to the world by making it
	  easier to copy and modify information.  Computers promise to make this
	  easier for all of us.</p>
	<p>
	  信息技术为世界作出了巨大的贡献，它使拷贝和修改信息更加容易。通过使用电脑，我们更容易做到这一点。</p>

	<p>

	  Not everyone wants it to be easier.  The system of copyright gives
	  software programs “owners”, most of whom aim to withhold
	  software's potential benefit from the rest of the public.  They would
	  like to be the only ones who can copy and modify the software that we
	  use.</p>
	<p>

	  但不是所有人都希望这样的事情发生。版权体制使得软件有了主人，他们当中多数人是为了对公众保留软件潜在的利益。他们企图对我们所使用的软件唯一有权进行拷贝和修改。</p>

	<p>
	  The copyright system grew up with printing—a technology for mass
	  production copying.  Copyright fit in well with this technology
	  because it restricted only the mass producers of copies.  It did not
	  take freedom away from readers of books.  An ordinary reader, who did
	  not own a printing press, could copy books only with pen and ink, and
	  few readers were sued for that.</p>
	<p>
	  版权体制是随着大量制作副本的印刷技术建立起来的。由于版权只限制了大规模的复制，所以与印刷技术配合的很好。这并没有剥夺读者的权力。没有出版社的普通读者就用笔墨拷贝作品，很少有人因此而被控告。</p>

	<p>
	  Digital technology is more flexible than the printing press: when
	  information has digital form, you can easily copy it to share it with
	  others.  This very flexibility makes a bad fit with a system like
	  copyright.  That's the reason for the increasingly nasty and draconian
	  measures now used to enforce software copyright.  Consider these four
	  practices of the Software Publishers Association (SPA):</p>
	<p>
	  信息技术比印刷出版社更有弹性，数字形式的信息更利于拷贝以共享给他人。信息技术的弹性与版权体制有冲突。这正是为何现在有许多下流而苟苛的软件版权措施。看看软件出版商协会（Software Publishers Association, SPA）四条措施：</p>	

	<ul>
	  <li>Massive propaganda saying it is wrong to disobey the owners
		to help your friend.</li>
	  <li>大肆宣传违返版权法去帮助朋友是不对的。</li>

	  <li>Solicitation for stool pigeons to inform on their coworkers and
		colleagues.</li>
	  <li>引诱大家去告发违返规定的同事和同僚。</li>

	  <li>Raids (with police help) on offices and schools, in which people are
		told they must prove they are innocent of illegal copying.</li>
	  <li>在警力协助下突击搜查公司、学校，人们则必须证明自己没有非法拷贝行为。</li>

	  <li>Prosecution (by the US government, at the SPA's request)
		of people such as <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of
									   Technology">MIT</abbr>'s David LaMacchia, not for copying software (he
		is not accused of copying any), but merely for leaving copying
		facilities unguarded and failing to censor their use.</li>
	  <li>在软件出版商协会要求下，美国政府起诉一些如<abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> David LaMacchia 这样的人，不是因为他非法拷贝软件，而只是因为没有升级他的拷贝工具，从而不能对用户非法拷贝软件进行检查。</li>

	</ul>

	<p>
	  All four practices resemble those used in the former Soviet Union,
	  where every copying machine had a guard to prevent forbidden copying,
	  and where individuals had to copy information secretly and pass it
	  from hand to hand as “samizdat”.  There is of course a
	  difference: the motive for information control in the Soviet Union was
	  political; in the US the motive is profit.  But it is the actions that
	  affect us, not the motive.  Any attempt to block the sharing of
	  information, no matter why, leads to the same methods and the same
	  harshness.</p>
	<p>
	  类似这四条措施苏联都用过，为了阻止非法拷贝，每一台打印机前都有一个守卫，个人不得不秘密拷贝信息，并像“地下出版物”一样手头传播。当然这里有所不同，苏联管制信息的目的是为了政治，而美国则是为了利益。但影响我们的是行为，而不是动机。不管为什么，只要是试图阻止信息共享的，都采用了相同的方法，都给我们带来不便。</p>

	<p>
	  Owners make several kinds of arguments for giving them the power
	  to control how we use information:</p>
	<p>
	  软件主人用许多主张来证明他们有权控制信息的使用。</p>

	<ul>
	  <li id="name-calling">Name calling.
	  <li id="name-calling">扣帽子

		<p>
		  Owners use smear words such as “piracy” and
		  “theft”, as well as expert terminology such as
		  “intellectual property” and “damage”, to
		  suggest a certain line of thinking to the public—a simplistic
		  analogy between programs and physical objects.</p>
		<p>
		  软件主人使用“盗窃”、“剽窃”这样的模糊词语，或者更专业的“知识产权”、“损失”，使大众把程序和物理实体单纯类比。</a>

		<p>
		  Our ideas and intuitions about property for material objects are about
		  whether it is right to <em>take an object away</em> from someone else.  They
		  don't directly apply to <em>making a copy</em> of something.  But the owners
		  ask us to apply them anyway.</p></li>
		<p>
		  我们对物质财产的想法和直觉是，拿走别人的东西是否正确。他们并不愿意拷贝一份给别人。但是软件主人却要求我们无论如何都接收他们的方式。</p></li>

	  <li id="exaggeration">Exaggeration.
	  <li id="exaggeration">夸大其词

		<p>
		  Owners say that they suffer “harm” or “economic
		  loss” when users copy programs themselves.  But the copying has
		  no direct effect on the owner, and it harms no one.  The owner can
		  lose only if the person who made the copy would otherwise have paid
		  for one from the owner.</p>
		<p>
		  软件主人声称当用户拷贝他们的程序时，他们遭受了经济上的损失。其实对任何人都没有损失。只有在使用拷贝版本的人愿意付费前提下，软件主人才会受损失。</p>

		<p>
		  A little thought shows that most such people would not have bought
		  copies.  Yet the owners compute their “losses” as if each
		  and every one would have bought a copy.  That is exaggeration—to
		  put it kindly.</p></li>
		<p>
		  很明显许多这种人不会去购买拷贝版本。但是软件主人会假定所有人都会购买，来计算他们的“损失”。客气点说，这就是在夸大。</p></li>

	  <li id="law">The law.
	  <li id="law">法律

		<p>
		  Owners often describe the current state of the law, and the harsh
		  penalties they can threaten us with.  Implicit in this approach is the
		  suggestion that today's law reflects an unquestionable view of
		  morality—yet at the same time, we are urged to regard these
		  penalties as facts of nature that can't be blamed on anyone.</p>
		<p>
		  软件主人总是提及当今的法律，并用严厉的处罚来吓唬我们。暗示一个观点，当今的法律无疑反映了我们的道德观念。同时，我们也被强迫接收这样的惩罚是合理的。</p>

		<p>
		  This line of persuasion isn't designed to stand up to critical
		  thinking; it's intended to reinforce a habitual mental pathway.</p>
		<p>
		  这些有心设计的说法是站不住脚的，只是有意利用了人的惯性思维。</p>

		<p>
		  It's elementary that laws don't decide right and wrong.  Every American
		  should know that, forty years ago, it was against the law in many
		  states for a black person to sit in the front of a bus; but only
		  racists would say sitting there was wrong.</p></li>
		<p>
		  显然法律是不能决定错对的。美国人都知道，四十年前许多州的黑人坐在车前抵制法律，但只有种族主义者才会说他们坐那是错误的。</p></li>

	  <li id="natural-rights">Natural rights.
	  <li id="natural-rights">自然权利

		<p>
		  Authors often claim a special connection with programs they have
		  written, and go on to assert that, as a result, their desires and
		  interests concerning the program simply outweigh those of anyone
		  else—or even those of the whole rest of the world.  (Typically
		  companies, not authors, hold the copyrights on software, but we are
		  expected to ignore this discrepancy.)</p>
		<p>
		  软件作者常常要求与自己写的程序有特殊关系，因此他们宣称自己对这个程序的渴望和兴趣是高于其他人的，甚至是除他之外的所有人。（往往代表性的公司拥有软件版权，而不是作者，但是我们希望忽略这个差异。)</p>
		<p>
		  To those who propose this as an ethical axiom—the author is more
		  important than you—I can only say that I, a notable software
		  author myself, call it bunk.</p>
		<p>
		  在那些把这当作道德格言的人看来，作者比用户更重要。作为一个编辑器的作者，我只能说这是胡扯。</p>

		<p>
		  But people in general are only likely to feel any sympathy with the
		  natural rights claims for two reasons.</p>
		<p>
		  但人们通常有两个理由来赞同自然权利。</p>

		<p>
		  One reason is an overstretched analogy with material objects.  When I
		  cook spaghetti, I do object if someone else eats it, because then I
		  cannot eat it.  His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits
		  him; only one of us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which?
		  The smallest distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical
		  balance.</p>
		<p>
		  一个理由是与现实事物的过分类比。当我做意大利面条时，如果其他人也要吃，我当然拒绝，要不我就吃不上了。他的行为对我的损害跟他受益一样大。我们中仅有一人可以吃意大利面条，问题是谁来吃？我们两者之间最小的分歧也足以打破道德的平衡。</p>

		<p>
		  But whether you run or change a program I wrote affects you directly
		  and me only indirectly.  Whether you give a copy to your friend
		  affects you and your friend much more than it affects me.  I shouldn't
		  have the power to tell you not to do these things.  No one should.</p>
		<p>
		  但是，你是否运行或者修改我写的程序会直接影响到你，并间接影响到我。你是否拷贝我的软件给你的朋友，比起我来对你和你的朋友的影响更大。我没有这样的权利告诉你不要这么做。任何人都没有。</p>

		<p>
		  The second reason is that people have been told that natural rights
		  for authors is the accepted and unquestioned tradition of our society.</p>
		<p>
		  第二个理由是，人们被告知，作者的自然权利是更容易被接受的，是毋庸置疑的社会传统。</p>

		<p>
		  As a matter of history, the opposite is true.  The idea of natural
		  rights of authors was proposed and decisively rejected when the US
		  Constitution was drawn up.  That's why the Constitution only
		  <em>permits</em> a system of copyright and does not <em>require</em>

		  one; that's why it says that copyright must be temporary.  It also
		  states that the purpose of copyright is to promote progress—not
		  to reward authors.  Copyright does reward authors somewhat, and
		  publishers more, but that is intended as a means of modifying their
		  behavior.</p>
		<p>
		  历史证明，相反的一面才是正确的。当制定美国宪法时，关于作者自然权利的想法被提议，并被坚决驳回。这就是为什么宪法容忍版权体制，但并不是需要版权体制，也是为什么版权体制只是暂时性的。同样，版权体制的目的是促进发展，而不是奖励作者。版权确实奖励了作者，但发行公司获益更多，他们有意掩饰了他们的行为。</p>

		<p>
		  The real established tradition of our society is that copyright cuts
		  into the natural rights of the public—and that this can only be
		  justified for the public's sake.</p></li>
		<p>
		  只从公众利益判断的话，已有的社会传统表明版权侵害了大众的自然权利。</p></li>

	  <li id="economics">Economics.
	  <li id="economics">经济

		<p>
		  The final argument made for having owners of software is that this
		  leads to production of more software.</p>
		<p>
		  关于软件应该有主人的最终辩解理由是，这会促使编写更多的软件。</p>

		<p>
		  Unlike the others, this argument at least takes a legitimate approach
		  to the subject.  It is based on a valid goal—satisfying the
		  users of software.  And it is empirically clear that people will
		  produce more of something if they are well paid for doing so.</p>
		<p>
		  不像其他理由，这个更切合实际一点。这是以满足软件用户为明确目标。从经验看来，如果人们付费，那他们会做出更多的软件。</p>

		<p>

		  But the economic argument has a flaw: it is based on the assumption
		  that the difference is only a matter of how much money we have to pay.
		  It assumes that “production of software” is what we want,
		  whether the software has owners or not.</p>
		<p>
		  但是关于经济的理由有点问题：它是基于一个假设，即不同之处仅仅是我们该付多少钱。假设无论软件是否有主人，制造的软件都是我们想要的。</p>

		<p>
		  People readily accept this assumption because it accords with our
		  experiences with material objects.  Consider a sandwich, for instance.
		  You might well be able to get an equivalent sandwich either free or
		  for a price.  If so, the amount you pay is the only difference.
		  Whether or not you have to buy it, the sandwich has the same taste,
		  the same nutritional value, and in either case you can only eat it
		  once.  Whether you get the sandwich from an owner or not cannot
		  directly affect anything but the amount of money you have afterwards.</p>
		<p>
		  由于这个假设合乎我们处理真实事物的经验，很容易被接受。想想三明治，不管你付费与否都能得到。如果是这样，不同之处仅在于付费的多少。不管你付费与否，三明治的味道和营养价值不会变，而且你只能吃一次。三明治有没有主人并不会直接的影响到任何事情，只会影响到你的收入。</p>

		<p>
		  This is true for any kind of material object—whether or not it
		  has an owner does not directly affect what it <em>is</em>, or what you
		  can do with it if you acquire it.</p>
		<p>
		  对所有事物都一样，有无主人不会直接影响它是什么、你得到它能用来做什么。</p>

		<p>
		  But if a program has an owner, this very much affects what it is, and
		  what you can do with a copy if you buy one.  The difference is not
		  just a matter of money.  The system of owners of software encourages
		  software owners to produce something—but not what society really
		  needs.  And it causes intangible ethical pollution that affects us
		  all.</p></li>
		<p>
		  但是如果程序有了主人，这将大大影响它是什么、你买一个拷贝版本能做什么。不同之处不仅仅是钱的问题。软件该有主人的体制鼓励软件主人编写一些软件出来，但不一定是社会真正需要的。这玷污的是我们的社会道德。</p></li>

	</ul>

	<p>
	  What does society need?  It needs information that is truly available
	  to its citizens—for example, programs that people can read, fix,
	  adapt, and improve, not just operate.  But what software owners
	  typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or change.</p>
	<p>
	  社会需要什么？社会需要对公民们真正有用的信息──例如，人们可以阅读、修改和改进的程序，而不只是能操作。但是软件主人往往会给我们一个不能学习和修改的黑盒子。</p>

	<p>
	  Society also needs freedom.  When a program has an owner, the users
	  lose freedom to control part of their own lives.</p>
	<p>
	  社会也需要自由。当程序有了主人，用户就失去了控制自己生活某部分的自由。</p>

	<p>
	  And above all society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary
	  cooperation in its citizens.  When software owners tell us that
	  helping our neighbors in a natural way is “piracy”, they
	  pollute our society's civic spirit.</p>
	<p>
	  总之社会需要鼓励公民们自主合作的精神。当软件主人告诉我们用这种自然的方式帮助邻居是剽窃行为时，他们正在玷污社会公民的人格。</p>

	<p>
	  This is why we say that
	  <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>

	  is a matter of freedom, not price.</p>
	<p>
	  这正是我们所说的，
	  <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">自由软件</a>
	  关心的是自由，而不是价格。</p>


	<p>
	  The economic argument for owners is erroneous, but the economic issue
	  is real.  Some people write useful software for the pleasure of
	  writing it or for admiration and love; but if we want more software
	  than those people write, we need to raise funds.</p>
	<p>
	  所有者所说的经济问题是错误的，但是经济问题确实存在。一些人出于个人爱好或者崇拜、博爱，在编写有用的软件，但是如果我们希望这些人编写出更多的软件，我们就需要给予赞助。</p>

	<p>
	  For ten years now, free software developers have tried various methods
	  of finding funds, with some success.  There's no need to make anyone
	  rich; the median US family income, around $35k, proves to be
	  enough incentive for many jobs that are less satisfying than
	  programming.</p>
	<p>
	  十年时间过去了，现在自由软件开发者已经尝试了许多寻求赞助的途径，并且一些很成功。这里不需要让任何人变富，大约三万五千美元的美国中等家庭收入，被证明足以吸引人们去干与编程相比，并不能使人满意的一些工作。</p>

	<p>
	  For years, until a fellowship made it unnecessary, I made a living
	  from custom enhancements of the free software I had written.  Each
	  enhancement was added to the standard released version and thus
	  eventually became available to the general public.  Clients paid me so
	  that I would work on the enhancements they wanted, rather than on the
	  features I would otherwise have considered highest priority.</p>
	<p>
	  多年以来，我一直靠改进我所写的自由软件为生，直到获得研究经费。每次改进我都会添加到标准发布版中，使得大众受益。客户为我付费，这样我就会优先考虑他们需求去改进，而不是我认为最需要的。</p>

	<p>
	  The <a href="/fsf/fsf.html">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>, a
	  tax-exempt charity for free software development, raises funds by

	  <a href="http://order.fsf.org/">selling</a>
	  GNU
	  <a href="/software/software.html">CD-ROMs</a>,
	  <a href="http://order.fsf.org/">T-shirts</a>,
	  <a href="/doc/doc.html">manuals</a>, and
	  <a href="http://order.fsf.org/">deluxe distributions</a>,
	  (all of which users are free to copy and change), as well as from
	  <a href="http://donate.fsf.org/">donations</a>.  It now has a staff of five
	  programmers, plus three employees who handle mail orders.</p>
	<p>
	  <a href="/fsf/fsf.html">自由软件基金会（Free Software Foundation, FSF）</a>是一个免税的开发自由软件的慈善机构，靠

	  <a href="http://order.fsf.org/">出售</a>
	  <a href="/software/software.html">CD-ROMs</a>、
	  <a href="http://order.fsf.org/">T恤</a>、
	  <a href="/doc/doc.html">手册</a>和
	  <a href="http://order.fsf.org/">高级发行版</a>
	  （上面这些用户都可以自由复制和修改），以及
	  <a href="http://donate.fsf.org/">捐赠</a>来筹集资金。现在有五个程序员和三个处理邮件的雇员。</p>

	<p>
	  Some free software developers make money by selling support services.
	  Cygnus Support, with around 50 employees [when this article was
	  written], estimates that about 15 per cent of its staff activity is
	  free software development—a respectable percentage for a
	  software company.</p>
	<p>
	  一些自由软件开发者通过支持服务挣钱。[此文撰写时] Cygnus 有近50个雇员，大约有百分之十五是搞自由软件开发──对一个软件公司而言，这是个了不起的比例。</p>

	<p>
	  Companies including Intel, Motorola, Texas Instruments and Analog
	  Devices have combined to fund the continued development of the free
	  GNU compiler for the language C.  Meanwhile, the GNU compiler for the
	  Ada language is being funded by the US Air Force, which believes this
	  is the most cost-effective way to get a high quality compiler.
	  [Air Force funding ended some time ago; the GNU Ada Compiler
	  is now in service, and its maintenance is funded commercially.]</p>
	<p>
	  包括 Inter, Motorola, Texas Instruments 和 Analog Devices 在内的公司联合赞助一直发展的 C 语言 GNU 编译器。同时，Ada 语言的 GNU 编译器受美国空防所赞助，这被认为是得到高质量编译器的最有效的途径。[空防所不久前终止了此项赞助，Ada语言的GNU编译器现在已经可以使用，并由其他商业公司赞助其维护。]</p>

	<p>
	  All these examples are small; the free software movement is still
	  small, and still young.  But the example of listener-supported radio
	  in this country [the US] shows it's possible to support a large
	  activity without forcing each user to pay.</p>
	<p>
	  这些例子都很小，自由软件运动也很小、很年轻。但是在这个国家[美国]公众支持的广播事业证明，不用强迫每个用户付费也可以支撑一个巨大的事业。</p>

	<p>
	  As a computer user today, you may find yourself using a
	  <a href="/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware">proprietary</a>
	  program.  If your friend asks to make a copy, it would be wrong to
	  refuse.  Cooperation is more important than copyright.  But
	  underground, closet cooperation does not make for a good society.  A
	  person should aspire to live an upright life openly with pride, and
	  this means saying “No” to proprietary software.</p>
	<p>
	  作为当今的一位计算机用户，你会发现自己用了
	  <a href="/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware">专有</a>
	  程序。如果你的朋友想要拷贝你的软件，拒绝是不对的。合作比版权更重要。闭门造车也不能形成良好的社交。人应当渴望过开放而正直的生活，这就意味着应该对专有软件说“不”。</p>

	<p>

	  You deserve to be able to cooperate openly and freely with other
	  people who use software.  You deserve to be able to learn how the
	  software works, and to teach your students with it.  You deserve to be
	  able to hire your favorite programmer to fix it when it breaks.</p>
	<p>
	
	  你应该能够与其他软件使用者开放、自由地合作，能够学习软件如何工作，并把这些教给学生，能够在软件出问题时请你最好的程序员修复它。</p>

	<p>
	  You deserve free software.</p>
	<p>
	  你应该得到自由软件。</p>
