红楼梦(Dream of red chamber)









The one is a god's flower in the court
The one is a perfect jade
If say no adventure
This life unlikily met he
If say have adventure
How the worry finally becomes virtual
III
The one is complainting in vain
The one is worrying for nothing
The one is the moon in water
The one is the flower in mirror
Think in eyes can hold how many tears
How can support autuwn goes to winter
Spring goes to summer
III




西游记









You carry burden
I pull horse
receive sunrise
say good-bye to sunset
overcome troubles
walking on avenue
finish fighting sufferings
geting going again
geting going again
come come come
a series of changes of seasons
you taste bitterness and happiness
dare to ask where is road
the road under foot
come come come
a series of changes of seasons
you taste bitterness and happiness
dare to ask where is road
the road under foot
the road under foot




个人观点，不能用“玷污经典”来完全否定这些“作品”，换一种表现形式，又有另一凡风味。
