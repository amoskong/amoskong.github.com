2024 is coming!

I had moved back to Xi'an-China for 7.5 years, we just celebrated the 8th years birthday, and my daughter is 1 year old. It's always happy to stay and play with children, they make my life more interest out of the busy work.

COVID finally terminated at the end of 2023, we don't need to waste time and money for COVID tests, the additional limitations in many areas started to cancel. It's a little bit delay than other countries, but it's the decision of our government, which we have to follow.

The economic concern is a hot topic around me in 2023, our company also cut stuffs, it's very hard for young graduate to find a job, unless they are very very outstanding.
