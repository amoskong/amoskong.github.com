It’s good to drink some red wine before sleep.

One night of three years ago, I suggested to drink some red wine with my wife, she accepted happily. But I only found one glass in the desktop, then I poured out double amount of wine to the glass, according to our regular capability.

Then my computer emitted a message, so I gave the glass to my wife without any comment, and went back around the keyboard.

After processed the task in computer, my wife already slept, and the glass was empty. She looked a little bit drunk, funny and lovely. I know she isn’t good at drinking, it’s the first time for me to see her drunk status, a shy girl.
