"Therefore, you must be patient with yourself and the computer while earning to  program. If you don't understand something the first time,reread it. If you still don't  understand it, it is sometimes best to take it by faith and come back to it later. Often  after more exposure to programming the ideas will make more sense. Don't get discouraged.It's a long climb, but very worthwhile."

From : "Programming.From.The.Ground.Up"
