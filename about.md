## Self-Intro

My Chinese name is "孔建军" (_Kong JianJun_), _Kong_ is my family name. My English name is _Amos Kong_.
I got my bachelor degree from the Computer Science Department of [Xi'an University of Post and Telecommunications](http://www.xupt.edu.cn/) in June 2009. Being very interested in [Programming](http://amosk.info/program.html) and [Linux Kernel](http://kernel.org/) Hacking, I chose a job of [Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM)](http://linux-kvm.org/) , [Qemu](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) and [Autotest](http://autotest.kernel.org/).
In my free time, I love to play musical instrument, football, ping-pong and sing songs.

Now I'm working at Beijing, China. You can see something about computer technology and my life from my [Blog](http://amosk.info/blog/) ([RSS](feed://http//amosk.info/blog/?feed=rss2)). There is also some [Links](http://amosk.info/blog/?page_id=169) of my friends.
